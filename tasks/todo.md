# Task: Add Tests for Shared Models

## Objective
Add unit tests for the data models in the `pkg/models` directory to ensure they are correctly defined.

## Todo Items
- [ ] Create `pkg/models/user_test.go` to test the User model.
- [ ] Create `pkg/models/dns_test.go` to test the DNS record models.
- [ ] Create `pkg/models/domain_test.go` to test the Domain model.

## Implementation Notes
The tests will be simple, ensuring that the structs can be instantiated and basic field assignments work as expected. This will form the basis for more comprehensive tests later.

## Review
Awaiting implementation.
